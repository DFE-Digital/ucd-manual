    <p>Our communities of practice are crucial to growing the maturity of design in DfE.</p>

    <p>The design communities of practice are:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>Content design</li>
        <li>Interaction design</li>
        <li>Service design</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Our communities of practice is led by the Head of Profession for Design, who is <a href="/design-ops#team">Andy Jones</a>.</p>

    <p>Our community objectives align to the <a href="/design-ops/">design ops</a> model. This means the work we do in our communities of practice help to improve:</p>

       <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>how we work together</li>
        <li>how we get work done</li>
        <li>how our work creates impact</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Our community meetups</h2>

    <p>We have regular profession-specific and all-design profession community meetups each month. We've chosen this schedule to allow people from other communities to join meetups and avoid clashes.</p>
