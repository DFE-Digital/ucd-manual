Services and websites hosted on non-GOV.UK domain names must still meet the [GOV Service Standard](gov-service-standards).

## If your service is not on service.gov.uk

For example, your service is being provided on education.gov.uk.

{{ list({
  "title": "Don't",
  "type": "cross",
  "items": [
    {
      "item": "use the GDS Transport typeface"
    },
    {
      "item": "use the crown or GOV.UK logotype"
    },
    {
      "item": "identify your service as being part of GOV.UK"
    }
  ]
}) }}

{{ list({
  "title": "Do",
  "type": "tick",
  "items": [
    {
      "item": "use the DfE header"
    },
    {
      "item": "use the Arial, Helvetical typeface font-stack"
    }
  ]
}) }}
