&lt;h1 class=&quot;govuk-heading-l&quot;&gt;Accessibility statement&lt;/h1&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;change colours, contrast levels and fonts&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;navigate most of the website using just a keyboard&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;navigate most of the website using speech recognition software&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most
      recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;govuk-body&quot;&gt;We&#39;ve also made the website text as simple as possible to
  understand.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;govuk-body&quot;&gt;We&#39;re always looking to improve the accessibility of this

&lt;h2 class=&quot;govuk-heading-m&quot;&gt;Enforcement procedure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;govuk-body&quot;&gt;The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) is
  responsible for enforcing the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile
  Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018 (the &#39;accessibility
  regulations&#39;). If you&#39;re not happy with how we respond to your complaint,
  &lt;a rel=&quot;noopner noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https://www.equalityadvisoryservice.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
      contact the Equality Advisory and Support Service (opens in a new tab)&lt;/a&gt;.
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;govuk-heading-m&quot;&gt;Technical information about this website&#39;s
    accessibility&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;govuk-body&quot;&gt;The Department for Education is committed to making its
    websites accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites
    and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;govuk-heading-m&quot;&gt;Compliance status&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;govuk-body&quot;&gt;This website is partially compliant with the
  WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) version 2.1
  AA standard, due to the following non-compliances (and/or) the following
  exemptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Non-accessible content&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;govuk-body&quot;&gt;The content is non-accessible for the following reason(s):
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;govuk-list&quot;&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;[Some images don&#39;t contain alternative text to describe the image which
  does not meet &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/text-equiv-all.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopner noreferrer&quot;&gt;
    WCAG version 2.1 AA - 1.1.1 Non-text Content&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Disproportionate burden&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;govuk-body&quot;&gt;We have determined that there is disproportionate burden
  to meet all the requirements for the following reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;govuk-list&quot;&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;[Making improvements would exceed budget for the year and leave the
    department unable to do other work - and would not significantly improve
    things for disabled users.]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The content is not within the scope of the accessibility regulations&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;govuk-list&quot;&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;[PDFs or other documents published before 23 September 2018 are out of
  scope of the regulations.]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 class=&quot;govuk-heading-m&quot;&gt;What we&#39;re doing to improve accessibility&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;govuk-body&quot;&gt;[Explain what you&#39;re doing to improve accessibility]&lt;/p&gt;
