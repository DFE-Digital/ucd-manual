<h2>Technical information about this website's accessibility</h2>

<p>The Department for Education is committed to making its websites accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.</p>

<h2>Compliance status</h2>

<p>This website is not compliant with the <abbr title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines">WCAG</abbr>  version 2.1 AA standard, due to the non-compliance(s) [and/or] the following exemptions.</p>

<h3>Non-accessible content</h3>

<p>The content is non-accessible for the following reason(s):</p>

<h4>Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations</h4>

<ul>
    <li>[Some images don't contain alternative text to describe the image which does not meet <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/text-equiv-all.html" target="_blank" rel="noopner noreferrer"><abbr title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines">WCAG</abbr>  version 2.1 AA - 1.1.1 Non-text Content</a>]</li>
</ul>

<h4>Disproportionate burden</h4>

<p>We have determined that there is disproportionate burden to meet all the requirements for the following reasons:</p>

<ul>
    <li>[Making improvements would exceed budget for the year and leave the department unable to do other work - and would not significantly improve things for disabled users.]</li>
</ul>

<h4>The content is not within the scope of the accessibility regulations</h4>

<ul>
    <li>[PDFs or other documents published before 23 September 2018 are out of scope of the regulations.]</li>
</ul>
