        </p>
        <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Implementation guidance</h4>
        <p>Where timeouts are implemented:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>tell users about the timeout, and what the timeout limit is, at the start of the process</li>

            <li>you could provide functionality to allow time limits to be extended</li>
            <li>timouts should only be allowed to be extended up to 10 times</li>
            <li>you could also provide functionality that allows users to set a timeout limit before they encounter a timeout, for example in settings</li>
        </ul>
       
        <p>Where timeouts are implemented using Javascript, you should have a non-javascript based approach to allow the user to manage the timeout.</p>
         <p>In addition to the implementation guidance, you should:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>provide an indication on the page as to when the page will time out and how to extend the timeout</li>

        <p>This could be by using the <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/inset-text/" target="_blank">Inset text</a> component for example:</p>

        <div class="govuk-inset-text">This page will time out at 4:30pm. To prevent the loss of information, refresh or save the page to extend the timeout period.</div>

        <p>When a user experiences a timeout, provide a way to get back to where they were.</p>
        <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">How to test with a visual check</h4>
        <p>If timeouts exist, conduct the following checks:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>when a timeout occurs while you are interacting with the pages, check that a warning message is displayed before the timeout occurs and that an option to extend the session is offered</li>
            <li>when a timeout occurs as a result of user inactivity, check that you are informed of the length of inactivity that would generate a timeout at the beginning of the process</li>
            <li>check if there is an option available for the user to adjust the timeout before they encounter it e.g. in settings</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In addition, you should check that:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>If the timeout occurs, that users are provided with a way to get back to where they were</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">How to test with JAWS and NVDA</h4>
        <p>Where a timeout exists, check:</p>

        </p>
        <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Implementation guidance</h4>
        <p>The visible focus order matches the logical order of navigation and interaction on the page.</p>
        <p>The easiest way to do this is to ensure the Document Object Model (DOM) follows the visual layout of the page, so your code has the same layout as your onscreen content.</p>
        <p>Only content which is interactive should appear in the focus order. Non-interactive content, for instance headings and paragraphs, should not get focus.</p>
        <p>Standard HTML components inherit the keyboard focus using the ordering of components in the code.</p>
        <p>Add keyboard support when you use non-standard HTML components, as these are not inherited.</p>
        <p>In general, the focus order should move across and down the screen in a ‘Z’ shape.</p>
        <p>If users move the focus dynamically, for example by opening a modal dialog, you must ensure that you programmatically manage the focus to the modal. Similarly, when a modal is closed, you should manage the focus back to the most logical location in the original document - usually the control which opens the modal. With modals, you should ensure that it remains within the modal and doesn’t stray into the document below.</p>
        <p>Dynamic controls should not reset or lose the focus.</p>
        <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">How to test with a keyboard</h4>
        <p>Use the Tab key to navigate the page and check that the actionable items (e.g. links, buttons, form fields) receive the focus in a logical order (i.e. the focus does not jump around the page).</p>
        <p>Check that any non-standard components have correct focus ordering.</p>
        <p>Check that focus is managed when interacting with modal dialogs.</p>

        <p>In additional to general navigation, your site should include at least one of the following:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>a site search available on every page</li>
            <li>a link to a site map, normally in the footer</li>

        </ul>
        <p>Exceptions to this are services which are made up of a series of steps or which have the primary purpose of looking up information.</p>
