        <p>Use the arrow keys, Enter key and Spacebar to reach and interact with all the user interface components on the page and check that the screen readers announce all the information necessary to understand the role and current status of the components and how to operate them.</p>

        <h3 id="4-1-3">4.1.3 Status messages</h3>
    <strong class="govuk-tag govuk-tag--red">Level A</strong> 
        <p>There are different situations where a page needs to dynamically display a status message. These messages need to be conveyed to assistive technology users, even when they don’t receive focus. Where possible, you should avoid disturbing the user’s place in a page.</p>
        <p>
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/status-messages"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Understanding Success Criterion 4.1.3: Status Messages</a>
        </p>
        <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Implementation guidance</h4>
        <p>Status messages or updates which occur visually should be communicated to screen reader users.</p>
        <p>These messages should be non-intrustive and only used when there is a benefit to the user, for instance informing them how many search results have been returned, that errors have occured in their submission or that a form has been successfully submitted.</p>
        <p>Generally, a notification/status message should be implemented using an ARIA live region (see <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#aria-live"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#aria-live</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/accessibility/aRIA/aRIA_Live_Regions"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/accessibility/aRIA/aRIA_Live_Regions</a>).</p>
        <p>Avoid using the assertive setting for aria-live regions. The polite setting is sufficent in most use cases.</p>
        <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Testing with JAWS/NVDA</h4>
        <p>When completing actions that involve a visual status message or information that a user needs to be made aware of, check that the message is announced to screereader users in a timely manner.</p>
        <p>Note - these messages should not interupt the screenreaders current activity but should relay the information at a suitable break in the screenreader audio.</p>
