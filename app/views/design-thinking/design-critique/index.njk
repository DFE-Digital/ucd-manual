Running a successful design critique involves setting clear objectives, creating a safe and constructive environment for discussion, and using a structured approach to feedback. Here are some steps to help you run a successful design critique:

Define the objectives: Start by defining the objectives of the critique. What do you hope to achieve? Is the goal to improve the design, get feedback, or generate new ideas? Make sure everyone is clear on the goals and expectations.

Choose the right participants: Select participants who have the relevant expertise and can provide constructive feedback. Avoid inviting people who might be disruptive or overly critical.

Prepare the materials: Prepare the design materials that will be reviewed in advance. Make sure they are accessible and easy to view, and provide context and background information as needed.

Set the stage: Start the critique by setting the stage and explaining the goals and expectations. Make sure everyone understands the format and rules of the critique, such as how much time each person has to speak, and how feedback should be given.

Use a structured approach: Use a structured approach to feedback, such as the "two stars and a wish" method. This method involves having each participant provide two positive comments ("stars") and one constructive criticism ("wish") about the design.

Encourage discussion: Encourage discussion and dialogue between participants, but make sure that feedback remains constructive and focused on the design. If disagreements arise, try to find common ground and move the discussion forward.

Summarize and follow up: Summarize the feedback at the end of the critique, and identify key action items that need to be addressed. Follow up with participants after the critique to ensure that action items are completed and to solicit further feedback.

Remember that a successful design critique is a collaborative process that requires an open and constructive mindset from all participants. With the right preparation, approach, and attitude, you can create an environment that encourages creativity, innovation, and continuous improvement.



<div class="dfeuk-timeline">
  <ol>
    <li>
      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Define the problem</h3>
      <p>Define the problem you want to solve and make sure everyone on the team understands it. Use a problem statement to help focus the team's efforts.</p>
    </li>
      <li>
      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Conduct research</h3>
      <p>Conduct research to understand the problem and identify potential solutions. This may include user research, market research, and competitor analysis.</p>
      <p>Examples of outputs:  User personas, user journey maps, competitive analysis reports.</p>
    </li>
      <li>
      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Sketch ideas</h3>
      <p> Encourage the team to sketch their ideas and solutions. This can be done individually or as a group.</p>
      <p>Examples of outputs: Sketches of potential solutions, mind maps, notes.</p>
    </li>
      <li>
      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Decide on solutions</h3>
      <p>Review the sketches and decide on the best solutions. This may involve voting, discussion, or a combination of both.</p>
      <p>Examples of outputs: Dot voting results, decision matrix</p>
    </li>
      <li>
      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Build a prototype</h3>
      <p>Build a prototype of the chosen solution. This can be a low-fidelity or high-fidelity prototype, depending on the complexity of the solution.</p>
      <p>Examples of outputs: Low or high-fidelity prototypes, wireframes, storyboards.</p>
    </li>
      <li>
      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Test with users</h3>
      <p>Test the prototype with users and gather feedback. This can be done through user testing, surveys, or interviews.</p>
      <p>Examples of outputs: User testing results, feedback notes, survey results.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>

By following these steps, you can run a design sprint and create a solution to a complex problem. 

The artifacts produced during the sprint can be used to communicate ideas, make decisions, and track progress throughout the process.
