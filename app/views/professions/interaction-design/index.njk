  <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What an interaction designer does:</h2>

  <p>Interaction designers are responsible for:</p>

  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>exploring design solutions by mapping user journeys and creating prototypes</li>
    <li>test hypotheses and assumptions which address user needs, behaviours and pain points</li>
    <li>contribute into, and support, other disciplines and help to shape direction</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Interaction designers do not:</h2>

  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>build fully functional services</li>
    <li>write production quality code and are not expected to</li>
</ul>

<p>Prototypes are design artefacts, not an exact representation of the fully developed service. Prototypes should only be built to test solutions to user's needs.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Expectations of interaction designers</h2>

  <li>follow the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/interaction-designer" target="_blank">skills and capability framework for interaction designers</a></li>
