<p>We want to help people understand what it's like to work in a design profession in the Department for Education.</p>

<p>Read our guidance and expectations of people working in the following roles:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li><a href="/professions/content-design">content design</a></li>
  <li><a href="/professions/interaction-design">interaction design</a></li>
  <li><a href="/professions/service-design">service design</a></li>
</ul>

<p>We encourage people in design professions to get involved in <a href="/community">communities of practice</a>.</p>
<p>Communities of practice enable us to grow the profession capability, share knowledge, skills, and be a supportive place to get help, advice and support.</p>
