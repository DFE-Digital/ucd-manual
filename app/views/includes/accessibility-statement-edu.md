<div class="call-to-action">
<p>[Note: start with a brief explanation of which websites or mobile apps the statement covers.</p>

<p>You can have a single accessibility statement that covers multiple domains, or a separate statement for each domain or subdomain. As long as the user can access relevant accessibility information easily from any page on your website.]</p>

<p>This website is run by [name of organisation]. We want as many people as possible to be able to use this website. For example, that means you should be able to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>change colours, contrast levels and fonts</li>
  <li>zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen</li>
  <li>navigate most of the website using just a keyboard</li>
  <li>navigate most of the website using speech recognition software</li>
  <li>listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)</li>
</ul>

<p>We’ve also made the website text as simple as possible to understand.</p>

<h3 id="enforcement-procedure">Enforcement procedure</h3>

<p>The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) is responsible for enforcing the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018
(the ‘accessibility regulations’). If you’re not happy with how we respond to your complaint, <a rel="external" href="https://www.equalityadvisoryservice.com/" class="govuk-link">contact the Equality Advisory and Support Service (EASS)</a>.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>[Note: if your organisation is based in Northern Ireland, refer users who want to complain to the Equalities Commission for Northern Ireland (ECNI) instead of the EASS and EHRC.]</p>

<h2 id="technical-information-about-this-websites-accessibility">Technical information about this website’s accessibility</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>[Note: this form of wording is legally required, so do not change it.]</p>
</div>

<p>[Name of organisation] is committed to making its website accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.</p>

<h3 id="compliance-status">Compliance status</h3>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>[Note: say that the website is fully compliant if the website meets WCAG 2.1 AA standard in full. Say that it’s partially compliant if it meets most requirements of the WCAG 2.1 AA standard. If it does not meet most requirements of the WCAG 2.1 AA standard, say that it’s not compliant.</p>

<p>If your website is either partially compliant or not compliant WCAG 2.1 AA standard, you’ll need to explain why. This will be due to one or both of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>non-compliances - this means the content in question is in scope of the regulations, but there’s an accessibility problem with it</li>
  <li>an exemption - this means the inaccessible content is out of scope of the regulations, or it’d be a disproportionate burden for you to make it accessible</li>
</ul>

<p>There’s a legally required way of expressing the compliance status of your website, so do not change it. The 3 options are as follows:]</p>
</div>

<p>This website is fully compliant with the <a rel="external" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/" class="govuk-link">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1</a> AA standard.</p>

<p>This website is partially compliant with the <a rel="external" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/" class="govuk-link">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1</a> AA standard, due to [insert one of the following: ‘the non-compliances’, ‘the exemptions’ or ‘the non-compliances and exemptions’] listed below.</p>

<p>This website is not compliant with the <a rel="external" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/" class="govuk-link">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1</a> AA standard. The [insert one of the following: ‘non-compliances’, ‘exemptions’ or ‘non-compliances and exemptions’] are listed below.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>[Note: delete the options that do not apply.]</p>
</div>

<h2 id="non-accessible-content">Non-accessible content</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>[Note: if the website is fully compliant with the WCAG 2.1 AA standard, you can leave the ‘Non-accessible content’ section out.</p>

<p>Otherwise, do not change the ‘Non-accessible content’ heading or the ‘The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons’ sentence - they’re legally required.</p>

<p>Do not change the ‘Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations’, ‘Disproportionate burden’ and ‘Content that’s not within the scope of the accessibility regulations’ subheadings: they’re also legally required.</p>

<p>But if you need to list a lot of problems, you can break these subsections up with further subheadings - for example, ‘Navigation and accessing information’ or ‘Interactive tools and transactions’.]</p>
</div>

<p>The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.</p>

<h3 id="non-compliance-with-the-accessibility-regulations">Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations</h3>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>[Note: In this subsection, list:</p>

<ul>
  <li>accessibility problems</li>
  <li>which of the WCAG 2.1 AA success criteria the problem fails on</li>
  <li>when you plan to fix the problem</li>
</ul>

<p>Do not include any problems where you’re claiming disproportionate burden, or where the problem is outside the scope of the accessibility regulations (those should go in the subsections below).]</p>
</div>

<p>Some images do not have a text alternative, so people using a screen reader cannot access the information. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.1.1 (non-text content).</p>

<p>We plan to add text alternatives for all images by September 2020. When we publish new content we’ll make sure our use of images meets accessibility standards.</p>

<h3 id="disproportionate-burden">Disproportionate burden</h3>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>[Note: in this subsection list accessibility problems you’re claiming would be a disproportionate burden to fix</p>

<p>Bear in mind that something which is a disproportionate burden now will not necessarily be a disproportionate burden forever. If the circumstances change, your ability to claim disproportionate burden may change too.]</p>
</div>

<h4 id="navigation-and-accessing-information">Navigation and accessing information</h4>

<p>There’s no way to skip the repeated content in the page header (for example, a ‘skip to main content’ option).</p>

<p>It’s not always possible to change the device orientation from horizontal to vertical without making it more difficult to view the content.</p>

<p>It’s not possible for users to change text size without some of the content overlapping.</p>

<h4 id="interactive-tools-and-transactions">Interactive tools and transactions</h4>

<p>Some of our interactive forms are difficult to navigate using a keyboard. For example, because some form controls are missing a ‘label’ tag.</p>

<p>Our forms are built and hosted through third party software and ‘skinned’ to look like our website.</p>

<p>We’ve assessed the cost of fixing the issues with navigation and accessing information, and with interactive tools and transactions. We believe that doing so now would be a <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/952/regulation/7/made" class="govuk-link">disproportionate burden</a> within the meaning of the accessibility regulations. We will make another assessment when the supplier contract is up for renewal, likely to be in [rough timing].</p>

<h3 id="content-thats-not-within-the-scope-of-the-accessibility-regulations">Content that’s not within the scope of the accessibility regulations</h3>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>[Note: in this subsection list accessibility problems that fall outside the scope of the accessibility regulations.]</p>
</div>

<h4 id="pdfs-and-other-documents">PDFs and other documents</h4>

<p>Some of our PDFs and Word documents are essential to providing our services. For example, we have PDFs with information on how users can access our services, and forms published as Word documents. By September 2020, we plan to either fix these or replace them with accessible HTML pages.</p>

<p>The accessibility regulations <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/952/regulation/4/made" class="govuk-link">do not require us to fix PDFs or other documents published before 23 September 2018</a> if they’re not essential to providing our services. For example, we do not plan to fix [example of non-essential document].</p>

<p>Any new PDFs or Word documents we publish will meet accessibility standards.</p>

<h4 id="live-video">Live video</h4>

<p>We do not plan to add captions to live video streams because live video is <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/952/regulation/4/made" class="govuk-link">exempt from meeting the accessibility regulations</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-were-doing-to-improve-accessibility">What we’re doing to improve accessibility</h2>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>[Note: publishing an accessibility roadmap is optional. It’s a good idea to publish one if you want to be specific about the order you’re planning to tackle accessibility issues, and there’s no space to do so in the accessibility statement itself.]</p>
</div>

<p>Our accessibility roadmap [add link to roadmap] shows how and when we plan to improve accessibility on this website.</p>

<div class="call-to-action">
<p>[Note: you do not have to use this approach to sampling, but you should link to a full explanation of what you tested and how you chose it. If you get a third party auditor to test your website for you, they should include sampling details in test report - so you can just to link to that.]</p>
