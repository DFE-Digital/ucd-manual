  <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="start-with-govuk-design-system">GOV.UK Design System first</h2>

  <p>If you are building a digital service, you must use the <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GOV.UK Design System</a> as a starting point for all DfE digital services.</p>

  <p>If something isn't in the GOV.UK Design System, check the <a href="https://github.com/orgs/alphagov/projects/43/views/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GOV.UK Design System backlog</a> to see what others have done before.</p>

  <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="start-with-govuk-design-system">DfE Design System</h2>
  
  <p>Work has begun on creating a DfE Design System. You can find components and patterns submitted by others and currently being worked on on the <a href="https://github.com/orgs/DFE-Digital/projects/22/views/13">Github backlog</a>.  
  
  <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="start-with-govuk-design-system">Ask what others have done</h2>

  <p>Before starting to build anything custom or new, ask what others have done in the following Slack channels:</p>

  <ul class="govuk-list">
    <li>
      <a href="https://ukgovernmentdfe.slack.com/archives/C7JG0399S" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#design channel in DfE Slack</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://ukgovernmentdigital.slack.com/archives/C062GAGLW" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#design channel in cross-government Slack</a>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>You can also <a href="/design-ops/">contact the Design Ops team</a> for advice and guidance.</p>

  <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="contributing-back-to-the-govuk-design-system">Contributing back to the GOV.UK Design System</h3>

  <p>If you create or amend an existing GOV.UK frontend component, you must also <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/community/contribution-criteria/" target="_blank">contribute the change back to the GOV.UK Design System</a>, along with evidence and research to support the change. </p>

  <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="branding">Branding your service</h2>
  <p>If you are designing a service which isn't intended to be provided on GOV.UK or service.gov.uk domains, you should follow the <a href="/design-system/branding-standards/">branding standards</a> guidance.</p>
