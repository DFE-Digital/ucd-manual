    <p>Proposals need to show that the component or pattern being suggested would be useful and unique.</p>

    <p>Follow the steps to propose a component or pattern for the Design System.</p>

    <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
        <li>
            <p>Check the list of issues on GitHub</p>
            <p>Check if someone else has already suggested your idea or something similar on the <a href="https://github.com/DFE-Digital/ucd-manual/issues" target="_blank">list of issues on GitHub</a>.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Raise an issue</p>
            <p>If your idea is not on the list, <a href="https://github.com/DFE-Digital/ucd-manual/issues/new/choose" target="_blank">raise an issue</a>. A member of the DesignOps team will review your proposal.</p>
            <p>At this stage, you just need to present your idea and evidence of the user needs. You can include screenshots or links to versions of the component or pattern in use, but avoid spending time working on a specific design or writing code.</p>

        </li>
    </ol>
