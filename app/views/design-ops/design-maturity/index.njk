    <p>We measure our maturity against the <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ux-maturity-model/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nielsen Normal Group - User Experience (UX) Maturity Model</a>. We run the survey every 6 months in March and September.</p>

    <p>The 6 maturity levels are:</p>

    <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
        <li>
            <strong>Absent:</strong> UX is ignored or nonexistent.</li>
        <li>
            <strong>Limited:</strong> UX work is rare, done haphazardly, and lacking importance.</li>
        <li>
            <strong>Emergent:</strong> The UX work is functional and promising but done inconsistently and inefficiently.</li>
        <li>
            <strong>Structured:</strong> The organization has semisystematic UX-related methodology that is widespread, but with varying degrees of effectiveness and efficiency.</li>
        <li>
            <strong>Integrated:</strong> UX work is comprehensive, effective, and pervasive.</li>
        <li>
            <strong>User-driven:</strong> Dedication to UX at all levels leads to deep insights and exceptional user-centeredâ€“design outcomes.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>We ran the first maturity survey in September 2022. This gave us a baseline measure and to identify any areas we need to focus on immediately.</p>
